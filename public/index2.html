<h1>The Best Movies According to Oscar</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-time</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Interstellar</h2>
<p>This movie is a beautiful story about space travel. A man has to travel through space in search of a viable place that humans can inhabit as the Earth no longer supports human needs. 
    Things do not go as planned and this man and his team end up spending more time than intended.<br /> The theme of the story is about love for family and humanity, coupled with the dynamics of space travel
    <br /> Least I forget, that soundtrack was one for the history books! Hats off to Hans Zimmer </p>
<h2>Joker 1</h2>
<p> I ended up watching this movie one uneventful afternoon where I was bored and had nothing to do. I have always been a fan of DC Comics so Joker was not an unknown character to me. 
    But this movie reintroduced the story of Joker to me from the first-person perspective.<br /> What blew my mind personally was how much I related to the story of Joker and the circumstances that birth his existence.</p>
<h2>MAVERICK: Top Gun</h2>
<p>This was a Tom Cruise movie...<br />
    That should end it there but let me elaborate. Tom Cruise is an elite US Navy Pilot (Rogue Pilot), he is tasked with preparing a group of young pilots for a deadly mission to neutralize an enemy's weapon.<br />
    The visuals, the cast, the sounds, the cool aircraft manuevers... This movie was perfect. Most importantly, it had me feeling like I was some Protege learning to embark on some risky mission in a 0% fat body</p>
<h2>Notable Mentions</h2>
<p>Overboard<br />
    Sinners... Damn Sinners was great, the director and the musical scene were what stool the show. PS: I HATE Musicals. So it says alot that I liked this one.
    Michael B Jordan was incredible!<br />
    Wanted to add one more but I have forgotten the movie title</p>
